            <p id="about-content">
                Hello and Welcome to my website! I am a full stack Web developer who love to write 
                clean, scalable, and sophisticated code. I am a new graduate from Rutgers University 
                where I studied Mathematics and Computer Science. There I was a member of multiple 
                acedemic organizations such as the Rutgers Undergraduate Mathematics Association and 
                the Undergraduate Student Alliance of Computer Scientist. During my time in college I 
                developed many interests in Literature, Philosophy, and Cognitive Science but most of all 
                discovered my passion for Mathematics and Computer Science. Before I went to college I spend
                two years working with adults with developmental disabilities at Alfa Development Inc.
                There I discovered how much I love to help and teach others. When I'm not coding or building
                responsive websites you can find me hard at work in the kitchen, going for a run, or spending
                time with my friends and family.
